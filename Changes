Revision history for Algorithm-QuineMcCluskey
	2015-1-1
	- No default parameters for find_essentials(). The primes
	  hash must be passed in, while the binary-formatted terms
	  are collectd from the object.
	2014-12-11
	- Method row_dom() was not actually affecting anything,
	  as it was creating its own hash ref without affecting
	  the contents of the hash ref passed in. Fixed that, but...
	- ... that left some empty arrays in the hash-of-arrays,
	  which were causing undef warnings in a "sum map" construct.
	  Created a new function countels() in Util.pm that does the
	  counting with a guard against empty array refs.
	  But unfortunately...
	- ... tests failed as no covers were being generated --
	  everything gets removed from the primes hash. So in the end,
	  commented out the calls to row_dom().
	2014-12-3
	- The weight count in find_primes() and the cost count in
	  recursive_solve() were using sum of a map block using
	  split. A match in list context is much simpler, changed
	  them to that (and put the function for it in Util.pm).
	2014-11-27
	- Add \Q and \E around don't-care character in maskmatcher()
	  substitution code in case someone chose a substitution
	  metacharacter as their don't-care character.
	2014-11-26
	- Changed maskmatcher() and remel() back from methods to
	  plain functions by passing in the dc field as a parameter.
	- Was looping around remel() for each arrayref in the hash.
	  Now just pass the hash in directly (this necessitated
	  changing one of the outer loops in purge_essentials).
	- And now that they're functions again, moved maskmatcher()
	  and remel() back to Util.pm, although remel() is now
	  called remels().
	2014-11-13
	- The test with don't-care terms randomly fails two thirds
	  of the time. Separate it into its own file, and add
	  debugging statements.

"deAlias"
	2014-11-4
	- Extended the object test to consider minterms, maxterms,
	  and columnstrings methods of creation.
	2014-10-31
	- Added columnstring attribute, and wrote bitstring code
	  for setting and getting it.
	- Changed minterms, maxterms, and dontcares back to
	  'rw', allowing the columnstring attribute to set them.
	2014-10-28
	- Changed to_boolean() to take an argument list instead of
	  automatically using the covers attribute internally. This
	  will allow the user (or the test files) to check terms before
	  or during minimization.
	- Separated out the var-by-var code from to_boolean(). Now it
	  calls a new method to_boolean_term() for each individual term
	  in the covers (or other) list, for easier output manipulation.
	2014-09-28
	- The 'covers' attribute gets changed from ArrayRef[Int] to
	  ArrayRef[Str].
	- Changed back find_essentials() to return the essentials hash
	  instead of $self, as there is code in recursive_solve() that
	  needs the hash in an inline fashion, and I'm not ready to touch
	  that part of the code yet.
	2014-09-21
	- Added namespace::autoclean as recommended in the Moose Best
	  Practices manual.
	- Changed the all the "terms" attributes to 'ro'.
	2014-09-19
	- For internal clarity, renamed allterms() to all_bit_terms(),
	  and minmax_terms() to minmax_bit_terms().
	- Fixed a couple of bugs in BUILD() where the minterms were
	  used where maxterms was the correct usage.
	- Methods maskmatch() and maskmatches() now combined into a single
	  method (one called the other, but there was no reason for the
	  separate internal function, and it saved re-creating
	  utility variables over and over).
	- Check if there's an overlap between the don't-care list and
	  the min or max term list, and call it an error if there is.
	- Attributes actually check the type now (thanks Moose) so
	  the qw operators around the term lists are now removed in
	  the documentation and in the test files.
	2014-08-20
	- No more default arguments (in the form of $self->get_primes())
	  for row_dom(), col_dom(), and purge_essentials(). Always
	  pass in the argument -- it's less confusing that way.
	- Trim Util.pm of tobits() -- it's embedded in BUILD now.
	- Those parentheses around remel()'s arguments aren't optional
	  when we're pushing the limits of the parser. Added them.
	2014-08-19
	- More work in find_primes(). An array slice in a hash isn't
	  working as originally coded (I seem to recall the rules
	  changing some time ago). Changed it to two statements for
	  now.
	- Also comment changes in find_primes(), hopefully explaining
	  the prime implicant search more completely, and maybe better.
	2014-08-13
	- Many changes to attributes -- altered the internal
	  ones to have "init_arg=>undef" and read-only options,
	  and added accessor methods.
	- Moved the "keys %$primes" out of the loop in find_essentials().
	  I think this was done to keep the local variable count to a
	  minimum, but the downside is the repeated operation for each
	  loop.
	- In the same line, separated the map function from
	  the map-grep-grep chain. Again, the reason seems to be
	  to avoid storing a list in a variable, but the end result is
	  a baroque technique involving dereferencing anonymous references,
	  all to see if it's a one-element list or not.
	- Also in find_essentials(), set the essentials attribute in
	  one go with local hash set up in the loop, rather than setting
	  each key individually per loop in the attribute.
	- find_essentials() and purge_essentials no longer return
	  the ->ess hash (the only thing using this feature was
	  the test files). Use the accessor method get_essentials()
	  if you really want to see the internals.
	2014-08-01
	- Move maskmatch(), maskmatches(), and remel() from Util.pm
	  to QuineMcCluskey.pm and made them object methods. Function
	  maskmatch() uses what is now an attribute of the object,
	  and maskmatches() and remel() are up the method calling chain.
	2014-07-28
	- 'width' is now a required field.
	- The BUILD method now sets the title if it isn't provided.
	2014-07-07
	- After looking over the labeling in the run.t file, added
	  a new attribute, "title". We can now say what the A::QMcC
	  object actually represents.
	- Broke up run.t into separate test files. The original
	  file was compact and in theory easy to add to, but I was
	  having trouble figuring out what was causing my Moose
	  errors. Plus, there were too many eval calls in the code.
	- The original code changed the minterms, maxterms, and
	  dontcares attributes from the passed-in list of decimal
	  into bitstrings, and saved them back in the attributes.
	  We can't do that now, because Moose has set those fields
	  are now typed as 'ArrarRef[Int]'.
	  So, set up three new fields that represent the three fields
	  in their bitstring form: min_bits, max_bits, and dc_bits.
	2014-04-30
	- Achieved a compile-error-free version using Moose instead
	  of Alias. Now to make it runtime-error-free.
	- As part of the compilation process, moved from a Makefile.PL
	  base (which was creating errors of its own) to Build.PL,
	  which Just Works.
	- Turned attributes boolean, imp, and bits into a local
	  variables as they were only used in single functions.
	- Defined and made use of predicate functions for attributes
	  minterms, maxterms, and dontcares. Simplifies some sanity
	  checks.
	- Added methods allterms() and minmax_terms() to simplify
	  coding.
	- List::MoreUtils isn't actually being used in A::QMcC (it is
	  used in A::QMcC::Util though).

	2013-10-25
	- Moosify ("has" declarations) the attributes. This is part
	  of the process to eliminate using Alias.pm.
	- Removed default value check in new(), which Moose has.
	- Removed prep_mopi() call, which doesn't seem to exist anywhere.
	- De-attr'd the attributes in find_perms.
