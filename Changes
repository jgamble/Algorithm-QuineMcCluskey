Revision history for Algorithm-QuineMcCluskey

"deAlias"
	2014-04-30
	- Achieved a compile-error-free version using Moose instead
	  of Alias. Now to make it runtime-error-free.
	- As part of the compilation process, moved from a Makefile.PL
	  base (which was creating errors of its own) to Build.PL,
	  which Just Works.
	- Turned attribute boolean to a local variable (like I did
	  also with attributes imp and bits) as it was only used in
	  a single function.
	- Defined and made use of predicate functions for attributes
	  minterms, maxterms, and dontcares. Simplifies some sanity
	  checks.
	- Added methods allterms() and minmax_terms() to simplify
	  coding.
	- List::MoreUtils isn't actually being used in A::QMcC (it is
	  used in A::QMcC::Util though).
	- Continue correcting my use of Moose syntax.

	2013-10-25
	- Moosify ("has" declarations) the attributes. This is part
	  of the process to eliminate using Alias.pm.
	- Removed default check in new(), which Moose has.
	- Removed prep_mopi call, which doesn't seem to exist anywhere.
	- De-attr'd the attributes in find_perms.
