"deAlias"
	2014-04-30
	- Achieved an compile-error-free version using Moose instead
	  of Alias. Now to make it runtime-error-free.
	- As part of the compilation process, moved from a Makefile.PL
	  base (which was creating errors of its own) to Build.PL,
	  which Just Works.

	2013-10-25
	- Moosify ("has" declarations) the attributes. This is part
	  of the process to eliminate using Alias.pm.
	- Removed default check in new(), which Moose has.
	- Removed prep_mopi call, which doesn't seem to exist anywhere.
	- De-attr'd the attributes in find_perms.
