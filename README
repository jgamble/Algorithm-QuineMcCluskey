Algorithm-QuineMcCluskey, version 1.00

This module creates objects designed to solve boolean expressions via the
Quine-McCluskey algorithm. Its effectiveness is dependent on the size of
problem; the number of minterms that can be set goes up exponentially with
the number of variables. It is likely that eight varibles may be the practical
maximum. However, speed and memory have improved, so upper limit of what is
practical to solve should be tested first.
