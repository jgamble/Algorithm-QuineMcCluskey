Algorithm-QuineMcCluskey

The following documentation is copied nearly verbatim from the module POD, and
may be stale. Reading the module POD is recommended.

NOTE: This module's API is NOT STABLE; the next version should support
multiple-output problems and will add more object-oriented features, but in
doing so will change the API. Upgrade at your own risk.

This module feebly stabs at providing solutions to Quine-McCluskey set-cover
problems, which are used in electrical engineering/computer science to find
minimal hardware implementations for a given input-output mapping. Since this
problem is NP-complete, and since this implementation uses no heuristics, it is
not expected to be useful for real-world problems.

The module is used in an object-oriented fashion; all necessary arguments can
be (and currently must be) provided to the constructor. Unless only a certain
step of is required, the whole algorithm is set off by calling solve() on an
Algorithm::QuineMcCluskey object; this method returns a list of boolean
expressions (as strings) representing valid solutions for the given inputs (see
the SYNOPSIS in the module POD).
